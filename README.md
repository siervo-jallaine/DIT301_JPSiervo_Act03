**REFLECTION**

**1. What design choices did you make (colors, fonts, layout)?** 

  The layout is single-column and centered to keep the focus entirely on the user's information. For the font, I 
stuck with a standard sans-serif type for maximum readability. The bright blue for the button was chosen to make 
the primary action, "Edit Profile," stand out.

**2. How did you ensure the screen is user-friendly and accessible?**

  Simplicity was key for user-friendliness. There's no clutter, so it's immediately clear what the screen is for.

**3. What would you improve if this were a real app?**

  First, I'd make the "Edit Profile" button functional, likely opening a modal or a new screen with a form to 
update the name, bio, and profile picture.
